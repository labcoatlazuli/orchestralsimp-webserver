## Description

Website for the Orchestral Simping Project (WIP).

The Orchestral Simping Project aims to set a new standard for VTuber-inspired orchestrations and arrangements.

The project is based on arranging melodies in 3 categories:

- VTuber-original: e.g. Shiny Smily Story (Hololive), Diamond City Lights (Nijisanji EN)
- VTuber-associated: e.g. Ochame Kinou / Fukkireta chorus, stream BGMs by other composers
- Original compositions

Other motivations:

- To learn the basics of web development
- To justify the domains I bought XD
  - Note: holo.simphony.moe and niji.simphony.moe will redirect to orchestralsimp.moe/hololive and orchestralsimp.moe/nijisanji respectively
